# Learn Python the Hard Way, 3rd Edition
# Exercise 3: Numbers and Math

The following are the available mathematical operator in base Python:

 - `+` Plus, **addition**
 - `-` Minus, negative, **subtraction**
 - `/` Slash, float division
 - `//` Double slashes, **integer division**
 - `*` Asterisk, **Multiply**
 - `%` Percent, **Modulo**
 - `<` less-than
 - `>` greater-than
 - `<=` less-than-or-equal-to
 - `>=` greater-than-or-equal-to

The hierarchy or the order of precedence for the mathematical operation in
python is following the standard, **PEMDAS** (Parentheses, Exponents,
Multiplication, Division, Addition, Substraction).

There are 5 study drills in this exercise, 3 of them use new scripts.

  1. Above each line, use the `#` to write a comment to yourself explaining
     what the line does.
  2. Find something you need to calculate and write a new `.py` file that does
     it.
  3. Rewrite `ex3.py` to use floating point numbers so it's more accurate.
